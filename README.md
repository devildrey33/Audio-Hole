# Audio-Hole

AudioHole is a multichannel analizer to display audio data, for now i use 6 channels (full song, bass, drum, piano, vocals and other) to display audio data in diferent shaders.
This allows to make simple animations using individual channels data as reference.

I have more complex animations for a specific song in a certain beat per minute using gsap (at the moment only 'Kill City Kills' song is using this)

Made with Three.js, pnmdrs postprocessin, gsap, and lil.gui (for debug)
